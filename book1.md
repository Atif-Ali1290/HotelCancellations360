##  Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking cancellations using Excel. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights behind booking behaviors and cancellation rates, visualized through a dynamic and interactive dashboard.

> **Objective**: Understand factors contributing to booking cancellations and empower businesses with actionable insights.

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Removed null and incorrect entries.
- Standardized formats and converted data types.
- Filtered unnecessary rows and columns.
- Created new calculated fields for better analysis.
- Prepared data tables for Pivot Table integration.

---

##  Pivot Tables & Dashboard Features

- Designed dynamic **Pivot Tables** to explore cancellation patterns.
- Applied **Slicers** for real-time filtering by:
  - Guest Type
  - Room Type
  - Booking Status
  - Year / Month
- Created a clean and visually appealing **dashboard** in Excel.

###  Visualizations Include:

-  Bar Charts (e.g., Cancellations by Room Type)
-  Pie Charts (e.g., Guest Type Distribution)
-  Line Graphs (e.g., Monthly Trends)
-  Stacked Columns (e.g., Cancellations vs. Confirmations)
-  Heatmap-style views for density insights

##  Key Insights

- Guests with longer lead times showed a higher cancellation rate.
- Family and Single guests canceled more often than Couples.
- No-deposit bookings were most likely to be canceled.
- Some room types had higher cancellation frequencies, indicating preference mismatches.

##  Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Dashboard)
- Excel Functions (IF, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP, etc.)
- Graphs & Slicers
- Data Modeling via Pivot Table framework

##  File Structure

- `Book1.xlsx`
  - **hotel_booking** → Cleaned dataset
  - **pivit_Table** → Pivot tables
  - **Dash Board** → Final visual dashboard

##  Why This Project Stands Out

-  End-to-end Excel BI solution
-  Real-world dataset and scenario
-  Clean layout and powerful visual storytelling
-  Business-friendly and stakeholder-readable
